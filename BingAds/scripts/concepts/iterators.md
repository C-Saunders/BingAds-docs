# What are iterators?

[!INCLUDE[preview-note](../includes/preview-note.md)]

Iterators enumerate items that a [selector](selectors.md) returns. Iterators are similar to arrays except you can't use an index to directly access an item. Iterators also help reduce memory pressure by loading only a single item at a time rather than the entire set of items. The following are the iterator methods.

- **boolean hasNext()** &mdash; Returns true if the current position is not the last item in the list
- **Object next()** &mdash; Advances the current position and returns the object at the new position
- **totalNumEntities()** &mdash; Returns the number of items available in the iterator.

The following code shows how to use an iterator to iterate over all campaigns in your account.

```javascript
var campaignIterator = BingAdsApp.campaigns().get();

while (campaignIterator.hasNext()) {
  var campaign = campaignIterator.next();
  Logger.log(campaign.getName() +
      "; active? " + campaign.isEnabled() +
      "; budget=" + campaign.getBudget().getAmount());
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> The iterators don't support the **for-of** loop construct. For example:
> 
> ```javascript
>     for (var campaign of BingAdsApp.campaigns().get())
> ```

The following is the list of iterators.
