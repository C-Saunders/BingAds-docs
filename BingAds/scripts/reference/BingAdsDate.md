# BingAdsDate

Contains properties that define a date.

Do not use this object to specify a date when calling one of the `forDateRange()` methods such as [AdGroupSelect.forDateRange()](AdGroupSelector.md#fordaterange~object-datefrom_-object-dateto~). Instead, you use this object to receive a date from methods such as [AdGroup.getStartDate()](AdGroup.md#getstartdate).


## Properties


|Property Name|Description|
|-|-
|day|The day of the month. For example, 30.
|month|The numeric calendar month, where 1 is January and 12 is December.
|year|The four-digit calendar year. For example, 2018.
