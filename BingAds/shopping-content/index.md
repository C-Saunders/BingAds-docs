# Content API Overview

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Bing Ads APIs, including Content API, will stop supporting managed user credentials (username and password) beginning August 1, 2018. At your earliest convenience, please migrate your account to use Microsoft accounts. For information, see [We're changing the way you sign in](https://help.bingads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/ext50875/-1/en-us). You will also need to change your code to use OAuth for authentication. For details about using OAuth, see [Authentication with OAuth](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bingads/guides/authentication-oauth?view=bingads-12).

Bing Ads Content API is a RESTful API that allows advertisers to programmatically 
manage their [Bing Merchant Center](http://help.bingads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/51083/1) catalogs. The Content API is an alternative to managing your catalog using the Bing Merchant Center web page or by using FTP. The Content API has the following advantages:

- Provides the ability to update product offers incrementally rather than uploading the entire data feed. Being able to update  a subset of your products is more efficient than having to upload the entire feed by using FTP.

- Provides the ability to make changes to product pricing and availability to reflect close to real-time market conditions. For example, if your product goes out of stock, you can quickly update its Availability field using the Content API.

- Provides the ability to batch together large numbers of items to process in a single request. A batch operation can include inserts, deletes, and updates. Using batch operations is a more efficient use of resources than using single operation calls (for example, a single insert operation).

- Provides the ability to download catalog status reports.

- Provides the ability to manage your catalogs programmatically.


## Who Should Use the API?
You should consider using the Content API if:

- You are currently using the Google Content API. 

- Your feed includes a large number of products.

- You are able to integrate the Content API with the rest of your inventory management systems.

If your catalog is small, or you have a limited ability to integrate with your inventory systems, you may be better off using one of the other methods for uploading your catalog (see [Submit your feed file](http://help.bingads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/51086/1)).
